# Hello 👋
I'm Łukasz from Poland. I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Applied Informatics and Management in Warsaw.

I currently have a solid foundation in C++, including syntax, pointers, STL, object-oriented programming (OOP) and exception handling. In addition, I am presently developing my skills in the Qt framework and working with SQL databases.
